# DeepCryptocurrency
Using long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to predict Bitcoin prices.

This code makes significant improvements on [code](https://github.com/jasonwei20/cryptocurrency-prediction) that my brother wrote.

I've written a blog post on this that you can find [here](https://medium.com/@jerrywei03/predicting-cryptocurrency-prices-with-machine-learning-1b5a711d3937).
